Last year, after I left Dropbox, I spent some of my break interviewing people in industry about the state of software development. I started a blog series based on those notes. I had always planned to finish publishing it over on [the personal blog](https://laughingmeme.org), and then clean it up and bring it here to the "work" blog. But that plan has lapsed because I got busy, and because I've held off on publishing the 4th part in the series looking at labor relations given what a difficult year it's been for tech.

First 3 parts:

  * [Software and its Discontents](https://laughingmeme.org/2023/01/16/software-and-its-discontents-part-1.html)

  * [Software and its Discontents, Part 2: An Explosion of Complexity](https://laughingmeme.org/2023/01/23/software-and-its-discontents-part-2-complexity.html)

  * [Software and its Discontents, Part 3: Rising Cost and Elusive Success](https://laughingmeme.org/2023/01/29/software-and-its-discontents-part-3-the-magic.html)
