Hi,

Iâ€™m Kellan. I made my first website in 1994. This is the lightly updated version.

I think a lot about software and leading engineering teams, complex systems, and engineering capacity for social change. Lately Iâ€™m thinking more climate change and healthcare.

I advise, and coach a handful of organizations who want more effective and higher impact engineering organizations. I very rarely invest.

Previously VPE Dropbox, SVP Blink Health, CTO Etsy, Flickr Architect, Tides Foundation Engineer, Palm Computing Principal Engineer, MetaEvents Founder.

Technical solutions for social problems. #47. A's dad. Hope before optimism.

For fun: ðŸš´ â˜• ðŸ¥¾ ðŸ“š ðŸŽ­
